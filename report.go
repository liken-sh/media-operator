// The report desk is the boundary between the bus and the reconcile
// loop. The operator subscribes to every Play's status and availability
// topic, and the bus handler folds each message in here. The reconcile
// pass reads the newest report per Play and writes it into the Play's
// status. The playback pod holds no API credentials, so this desk is
// the only path a report takes to the control plane.

// reports holds the newest report per run and the wake the loop reads.
// One mutex covers the maps, because the bus handler runs on the bus
// reader's goroutine and the loop runs on its own.
//
// seen holds every run the desk has taken any bus message for, online or
// offline. latest drops a run the moment it goes offline, so it cannot
// answer which runs still have a retained topic on the broker; seen can,
// and it is how the operator finds a deleted Play's gravestone to clear.
//
// ended holds, for each run that reported the ending, the UID of the pod
// that reported it. It is kept beside latest rather than read out of it,
// because the sidecar publishes the ending and then goes offline, and
// offline drops the latest report. The mark has to outlive that drop: the
// pod lives on for seconds after the film is over, and the Player is idle
// for every one of them. The mark counts only while its pod is the run's
// pod (runpod.go), so the ending of a pod that crashed or was deleted
// stops counting once the run moves on to a new pod.
//
// pods is what tells the run's current pod from an older one under the
// same name. runpod.go says how.

// The ending, a pause, or an item change is what a person waits to see,

// looking at the screen for: the pass it wakes is what turns the idle
// screen back on. A position that only advances updates the desk and
// wakes nothing: the reconcile pass reads the current position off the
// desk on its next tick, so a steadily playing film writes its
// resource on that interval and not on every report. This is the
// throttle that keeps a one-second bus cadence from becoming a
// one-second write to etcd.
//
// The mark follows the report rather than latching, so a Play recreated
// under the same name reports a run of its own and starts not ended.
//
// fold answers whether this report is where the run's ending began, which
// the caller reads to publish the unit's idle state at once. It is the
// mark and not the previous report that decides that, because a sidecar
// that goes offline drops the previous report while the mark stands, and a
