// The claims, the ResourceSlices, the Displays, the Receivers, and the
// operator's own pods wake the pass when a change reaches a field the
// pass reads, and a change to anything else wakes nothing. Each rule names those fields as a
// mark, and the handler compares the mark of the copy the informer held
// with the mark of the new copy. The informer hands an update both, so
// the handler keeps no copy of its own.
//
// Each mark leaves out what this operator writes itself, so its own
// write does not wake the pass that made it: a Display's spec.override,
// and a Receiver's session in its spec and its status. A claim's spec
// is immutable, and the operator writes nothing else on a claim, so a
// claim's mark is what the scheduler writes. Each mark holds the UID
// and the deletion mark too. After a gap in the watch, an object
// deleted and created again with the same name reaches the handler as
// an update, and a deletion request changes what the pass does.
//
// After a gap, the informer reports each difference from what it held
// as an addition, an update, or a deletion, so the same rules cover a
// change made while the watch was down.
