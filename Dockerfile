# The operator's image: one static Go binary and nothing else. The
# operator holds the cluster credentials and writes every status, so
# its image carries no shell, no libc, and no tools, which is the
# least there is to attack.
#
# The player image (mpv under this same program as its supervisor) and
# the idle image build from the two Dockerfiles beside this one. The
# sidecar image is this image under a second name: release.yaml tags
# it, and no Dockerfile builds it. A release ships all four together.
#
# The image holds two builds of the program. /media-operator is the
# full build, and the operator runs it. /media-operator-pod is the pod
# build, with the build tag pod, and every sidecar container the
# operator creates runs it. The pod build leaves out client-go's leader
# election, which the operator alone needs, so the program that runs in
# every playback pod and every Remote's pod is less than half the size
# and takes less than half the memory at start. leader_pod.go says why.
# The sidecar image is this image, so each node that runs a sidecar
# pulls both builds, about 40MB where one build was 17MB.
